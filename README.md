# Word-Unscrambler
Gives all the possible words you can create using all the given letters

Time is exponential so anything with 6 letters of less will be fast. 7 letters will take 30 or so seconds. 8 letters, a couple of minutes. You get the idea.

I'd like to add a feature where you can see all the possible words that can be created including those with fewer letters. For example, the letters: soher - would return: horse, shoe, so, etc.
